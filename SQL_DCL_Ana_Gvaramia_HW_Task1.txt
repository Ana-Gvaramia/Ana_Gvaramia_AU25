Analysis:

In this particular database, almost no deliberate security precautions have been implemented, but it is accidentally quite secure at the moment because:
•	Only the superuser role postgres exists and owns everything - Only the postgres superuser can log in and perform any action
•	No Table-Level or Column-Level or Row-Level privileges have been granted to PUBLIC or any other role 
•	Schema-Level default USAGE + CREATE for PUBLIC exist
•	Therefore, only the database owner can read or modify data.
