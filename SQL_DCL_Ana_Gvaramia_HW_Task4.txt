1. How can one restrict access to certain columns of a database table?

There are two main methods:
- Column-Level Privileges (DCL) - Grant SELECT, INSERT, or UPDATE permissions only for a specified list of columns directly on the table.
- Using Views - Create a virtual table (View) that includes only the allowed columns. Users are then granted privileges solely on this View, not the underlying table.

2. What is the difference between user identification and user authentication?

User Identification -
Goal: To state who the user claims to be
Input: Username (role name) provided during connection
Result: Establishes the current_user session

User Authentication -
Goal: To prove the identity
Input: Password, token, or certificate presented
Result: Grants or denies connection access

3. What are the recommended authentication protocols for PostgreSQL?

SCRAM-SHA-256: The industry standard for password authentication. It uses modern hashing and salting to prevent cleartext transmission and protect against rainbow table attacks

Certificates: Highly secure method where the client presents a cryptographic certificate. It eliminates passwords, binding identity to a private key

GSSAPI: Recommended for integrating PostgreSQL with centralized corporate directory services

4. What is proxy authentication in PostgreSQL, and what is it for? Why does it make RBAC easier to implement?

Proxy authentication is when an application connects to PostgreSQL using a single, high-privileged proxy role. It is used primarily for reducing connection overhead and centralizing authentication.

Proxy authentication is essential for making Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) effective. By using SET ROLE, the database's current_user variable is correctly set to the end-user's identity. The database session, while persistent, operates under the minimal permissions of the end-user's role, greatly enhancing security over using the single high-privileged proxy role for all actions.
